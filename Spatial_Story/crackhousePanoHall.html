		// to -1.  x or y works fine.  But just 1.
		cube.scale.x = -1;
		
		// now add the cube to the scene.  By default our camera is at the center of the scene at 0 on the x, y and z
		// because we flipped the cube inside out and its 120 units big and it is also at 0.  We are in the center
		// of a big cube mapped with images from a panorama.  This method of rendering 3d panos is called a skybox.
